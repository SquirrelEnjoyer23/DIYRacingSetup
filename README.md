As a racing sim "connoisseur" i have always wanted to make my own setup but i had a BIG problem, my desk doesnt allow for mounting a wheel and since my desk is so small using one with suction cups would take up a lot of space, and i dont have the money to invest in a whole rig to fit everything onto i have decided to make my own wheel that can meet my criteria, But on the good side i dont want any force feedback which can make this project even easier, so the criteria i need it to meet is that it is small, easily connectable to a computer, and feels nice to use, however i also want it be able to get expanded on such as adding pedals or a shifter later on, so the option for expansion should be made available.
