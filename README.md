As a racing sim "connoisseur" i have always wanted to make my own setup but i had a BIG problem, my desk doesnt allow for mounting a wheel and since my desk is so small using one with suction cups would take up a lot of space, and i dont have the money to invest in a whole rig to fit everything onto i have decided to make my own wheel that can meet my criteria, But on the good side i dont want any force feedback which can make this project even easier, so the criteria i need it to meet is that it is small, easily connectable to a computer, and feels nice to use, however what would a racing setup be without a shifter as well so i would also need to make one that would be able to connect to the desk as well as being easily connectable to the wheel as that will be the part that houses the main brains of the operation, as for any sort of pedals ive decided to wait for a later date to do that but that would mean i would want a open port on the wheel allowing for that future expansion, and for these connections ive decided to use usb c as its a fairly common standard and most people already have usb c cables laying around that could be used.
